Solarized for Alfred
===

Hey, if you're not using Solarized, what are you thinking?

Let's take two of my favorite things - [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) - and make something really legible and awesome.

**I'm freaking colorblind. Give me a break**. If something doesn't look right, fork and submit a pull request. You know the drill.

(Colors are based on guidelines established by [Mr. Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized#the-values).)
